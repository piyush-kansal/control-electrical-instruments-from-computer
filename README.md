Control Electrical instruments via Computer
-------------------------------------------

This project lets a user control electrical instruments like lights, fans, bulbs 
via computer. By control, we mean switch on and off, so he can switch on and off
a fan from his computer terminal.

This project consists of two parts:
	- a DOS based program, responsible for providing user with an interface
	controllable for a mouse to turn on and off an electrical gadget

	- a circuit board which connects to the parallel port of a computer and takes
	inputs from that port, processes it and turn on or off the requested device
	connected to the other end of the circuit board. I do not have the circuit board
	layout as of now
